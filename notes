You will see a messags along the lines 'unknown database "pabloportabales"). Let's create that database for you so that you can loging without having to specify the database:

psql postgres

postgres# create database "ecomba";

CREATE DATABASE

postgres# \q


cucumber-sinatra init --app  BattleShips lib/battleships.rb

In server.rb:

The second argument to setup() is called a connection string. It has the following format.

dbtype://user:password@hostname:port/databasename

By default Postgres.app is configured to accept connections from a logged in user without the password, so we omit them. Since postgres is running on the default port 5432, it doesn't have to be specified either.

psql:
\list lists all databases
\dt lists all tables in the current database
 psql book_manager_test

rspec --init creates .rspec and spec/spec_helper.rb

rvm install 2.1.3
rvm use --default 2.1.3


capybara can be used with cucumber or rspec, in this project we are using it with rspec, in battlehips we used it with cucumber

 set :views, Proc.new { File.join(root, "..","views") }
 set :public_folder, 'public'
 enable :sessions
